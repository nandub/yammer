BASE SERVLETS FOR AUTHENTICATION

WebKit Sessions will be used for authentication.  Pages that require
an authenticated user will be derived from the servlet
  AuthYammerPage
and those that do not will be derived from
  YammerPage
AuthYammerPage itself will be derived from YammerPage.  YammerPage
will have a login widget on the side, at the top, or in some other
prominent but out of the way spot; in the equivalent spot,
AuthYammerPage will have a logout button.

If an attempt is made to render an AuthYammerPage without valid
authentication, the browser will be redirected to the guest page,
which is derived from YammerPage.

/index.psp: derived from AuthYammerPage; where one is sent after
            successful login or registration
/guest/index.psp: derived from YammerPage; where one is sent if
                  bounced by an AuthYammerPage
/register/index.psp: derived from the registration page



In the user's Session, the following data is stored:
  'username': the user's name, which must consist of identifier
              characters
