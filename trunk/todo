* buildnum for non-cvs deployment?

--

* for use as a forum for specific web sites (i.e. etymongrel, Pat
  Cullen's NCAA betting pool)
  - create user through marmaduke
  - provide a web service that allows setting subs.quick -- maybe
    generic user preferences xml-rpc API; should support an
    "isDefault" method per-pref; if the subs.quick pref for the user
    does not have the default value, the user may have changed it, and
    we should append instead of overwriting; alternately, only prepend
  - some form of quick category instructions?
