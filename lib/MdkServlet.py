  The 100-series fault codes represent user-level errors, and the
  corresponding fault strings are suitable to be displayed to a user.
  Fault codes lower than 100 represent server-side errors and the
  fault strings contain information that would be useful in a bug
  report.

  Some servers, based on their key-signing policy, may not support
  some methods.  An attempt to call an unsupported method will result
  in fault code 99.
